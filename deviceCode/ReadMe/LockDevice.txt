LockDevice

The device that is wired up to actuate a deadbolt. Assume that 
the device is a raspberry pi 4 and that the the device and 
deadbolt has been wired together.

Software Installation

[1] Run the requirnments.txt using
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

[2] In sysVariable.py edit the file paths according to 
    the instructions in the file. This will allow the program to store, 
    retrieve, and edit information that will allowd the program to run. 
    Additionally, you will also need to download the AWS certification
    files for your thing and add the paths into the sysVariable.py document.

[3] Run the program with 
    $ python3 lock.py

Hardware Installation

    [3] 3 18650 batteries
    [4] Battery holder
    [5] Wiring for pins and connections
    [6] Relay 12V 

Steps to Set up Lock Circuit

Testing and Evaluaiton

The testing can be found in testing.py. Running this file will 
activate the deadbolt and close it after 30 seconds. That is
the main test. Additionally, a client connection will be made 
which will echo a result to the cloud to test and ensure it is
working and publishing / receiving.
Check the lambda cloud logs in cloudwatch by clicking on your lambda function, 
navigating to monitor, and view logs in CloudWatch. Click on the latest 
execution to see what is occruing. This will allow you to see execution
details such as performance information.
