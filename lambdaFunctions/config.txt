The following project includes the code to create a facial recognition
locking service. The code can be broken up into 3 parts

[1] cameraDevice: This is everything that is to be run on the camera device.
It includes its own readMe for setup, and offers the functionality of the 
camera IoT device in the IoT enables facial recognition lock.
[2] lockDevice: All includsive of code to run on the lock device. In its current
state it supports a deadbolt, but can be easily modified to work with any
other lock. It too has its own readMe that will go over hardware configuration
and software.
[3] lambdaFunctions: All of the lambda functions that need to be run in the cloud.
The readMe for this module is a bit more intense and requires configuration with 
and AWS account. Everything can be completed in the AWS console. 

When setting up this project, it is recommended that the cloud side be done first. 
Which will allow some minor testing and debug during the clients creation. The second
step would be to create the cameraDevice. Test it. Then move to the next device,
the lockDevice. The functions can be tested via their own documentation. 

Re-highlighting that the sysVariable needs to be updated to the correct paths, 
information on doing this can be found in the file.
